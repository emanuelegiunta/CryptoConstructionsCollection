Papers list
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item \cite{PKC:DodYam05}: Compact VRF with "small" message space (or "long" proofs) from q-SDH. (Not sure why the message space has to be small in their construction).

	\item \cite{EPRINT:EKSSZSC20}: Efficient from lattices, introduces the Game-based notion of unbiasability.
	
	\item \cite{EPRINT:EEKLSSYZ22}: Indexed VRF (for forward security). Extends the notion of unbiasability to this setting.	
\end{itemize}
